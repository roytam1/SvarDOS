PKG - the package manager for the SvarDOS system.

PKG installs, updates and removes software *.SVP packages. Such packages are
distributed with the SvarDOS system and may also be obtained with the
pkgnet net from the online SvarDOS repository.

PKG is configured through the %DOSDIR%\CFG\PKG.CFG configuration file. This
file provides information about the directories where packages have to be
installed. An example is shown at the bottom of this file below.

PKG can display its messages in a variety of languages. To select its language,
it looks at the %LANG% environment variable (for example "SET LANG=PL") and
loads translated messages from its PKG.LNG language file, that should be in the
same directory as PKG.EXE. If the LNG file cannot be found, or if the %LANG%
variable points at a language that is not supported by PKG, then all messages
are displayed in english.
