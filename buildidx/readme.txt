buildidx is a little program that generates an index.tsv file for the SvarDOS repository.


* Requirements *

To operate properly, buildidx needs 'unzip' to be available.


* How to use it *

Put all your packages into a single directory, for ex. "mystuff", and call buildidx with the directory as a parameter:

./buildidx mystuff
