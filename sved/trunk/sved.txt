                           Sved, the SvarDOS editor

                       Copyright (C) 2023 Mateusz Viste


Sved is the editor that comes with SvarDOS. You will may find that it lacks
many amenities. Sved is NOT meant to be a fullfeatured text editor. It is
designed to allow for basic editing of configuration files, nothing else. On
the pro side Sved has a low memory footprint and is only a dozen of kilobytes
long which makes it a good fit on bootdisks or systems with very limited
ressources.

- able to run comfortably on a 8086-class PC with 256 KiB of RAM
- support for monochrome screens
- multilangual UI
- low disk footprint (16 KiB max)
- ability to edit files larger than 64 KiB
