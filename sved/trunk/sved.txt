Sved is the editor that comes with SvarDOS. Sved is not meant to be a
full-featured text editor, it is designed to allow for basic editing of
configuration files, nothing more. On the pro side Sved has a low memory
footprint and is only a couple of kilobytes big, which makes it a good fit on
bootdisks or systems with limited ressources.

 - runs comfortably on a 8086-class PC with 256 KiB of RAM
 - supports color and monochrome video modes
 - supports extended text modes like 80x43, 80x50...
 - multilingual UI
 - low disk footprint (8 KiB)
 - handles files larger than 64 KiB
 - no limit on line lengths
