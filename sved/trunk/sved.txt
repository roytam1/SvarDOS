Sved is the default editor that comes with SvarDOS. Sved is not meant to be a
full-featured text editor, it is designed for basic editing of configuration
files and such. On the pro side, Sved has a very low memory footprint and
is only a couple of kilobytes big, which makes it a good fit for bootdisks or
systems with extremely limited ressources.

 - runs comfortably on a 8086-class PC with 256 KiB of RAM
 - supports color and monochrome video modes
 - supports extended text modes like 80x43, 80x50...
 - multilingual UI
 - low disk footprint (8 KiB)
 - loads files larger than 64 KiB
 - no limit on line lengths
 - handles CR/LF and LF line endings (+can convert between the two)

What Sved does NOT have:

 - stylish pull-down menus
 - mouse support
 - any integrated file browser
 - multiple files interface
 - copy/paste support
 - undo
 - search
 - ...

Sved is released under the terms of the MIT license.
