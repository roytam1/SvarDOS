### WHAT IT IS ###############################################################

The SvarDOS editor (SVED) is designed for basic editing of configuration files
and such. It is NOT meant to be a full-featured text editor. On the pro side,
it has a low memory footprint and is only a couple kilobytes big, which makes
it a good fit for bootdisks and systems with extremely limited resources.

 - runs comfortably on a 8086-class PC with 256 KiB of RAM
 - autodetects color and monochrome video modes
 - supports unusual text modes like 80x43, 80x50, 40x25...
 - multilingual UI
 - only 7 KiB of disk footprint
 - loads files larger than 64 KiB
 - no line length limit
 - can load up to 10 files simulteanously
 - handles CR/LF and LF line endings and can convert between them

What SVED does NOT have:

 - mouse support
 - an integrated file browser
 - undo
 - search
 - ...


### USAGE AND KEY BINDINGS ###################################################

Navigation within the text file is achieved through the usual, standard keys:
 - up, down, right and left arrows
 - PageUp / PageDown
 - Home / End

On top of these, the following key bindings are available:

ESC        = access the program's menu
CTRL+RIGHT = jump to next word
CTRL+LEFT  = jump to previous word
CTRL+C     = copy the current line to clipboard
CTRL+X     = cut the current line and move it to clipboard
CTRL+V     = paste the clipboard content to current location

SVED can load up to 10 files simultaneously. To switch from one file to
another use the F1..F10 function keys (F1 = file 1, F2 = file 2, etc).


### MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT #####################################################

The LNG file contains non-english strings. It should be placed in the same
directory where the program's executable resides. The UI language is
controlled by the LANG environment variable, for example SET LANG=PL would
make it display polish strings.

If you rename the SVED.COM executable (for example to EDIT.COM), then you need
to rename the LNG file accordingly (for example to EDIT.LNG).

You can safely delete the LNG file if you do not need non-english UI and wish
to free some disk space.
