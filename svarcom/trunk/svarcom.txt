SvarCOM is the SvarDOS command line interpreter, known usually under the name
"COMMAND.COM". It is designed and maintained by Mateusz Viste, and distributed
under the terms of the MIT license.

For the time being, it is an incomplete, "work in progress" project. The goal
is to make SvarCOM the default SvarDOS shell, replacing FreeCOM.

Why replacing FreeCOM, you ask? See FREECOM.TXT for details.


Since SvarCOM is a work-in-progress effort, it still lacks a few things:

- no support for pipes (eg. file.exe | more)
- no support for batch (*.BAT) files (hence no AUTOEXEC.BAT execution)
- a few internal commands missing: CALL, CTTY, GOTO, IF, LH, SHIFT
