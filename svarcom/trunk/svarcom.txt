SvarCOM is the SvarDOS command line interpreter, known usually under the name
"COMMAND.COM". It is designed and maintained by Mateusz Viste, and distributed
under the terms of the MIT license.

The goal is to make SvarCOM the default SvarDOS shell, replacing FreeCOM.
Why replacing FreeCOM, you ask? See FREECOM.TXT for details.

SvarCOM is a work-in-progress effort. As such, it still lacks a few things:
 - a few internal commands missing: CALL, CTTY, GOTO, LH
 - DIR misses two switches: /S, /O

SvarCOM is minimalist and I'd like to keep it that way. It aims to be
functionaly equivalent to COMMAND.COM from MS-DOS 5.x/6.x. No LFN support.

As of version 2022.0, SvarCOM's resident footprint is under 2 KiB.

Translation strings are stored in the file SVARCOM.LNG, which should be
placed in a directory pointed at by %NLSPATH% for SvarCOM to be able to output
messages in non-english languages. SvarCOM's language is controlled by the
%LANG% environment variable. NOTE: at this time translations aren't available
yet, with the proof-of-concept exceptions of the 'PAUSE' and 'SHIFT' commands.
