=== ver 2022.3 (xx.xx.xxxx) ==================================================

 - fixed stdin redirection handling (was broken since 2022.1)
 - added German translations, courtesy of Robert Riebisch (bttr)
 - added French translations, kindly contributed by Berki Yenig√ºn (thraex)


=== ver 2022.2 (04.03.2022) ==================================================

 - added support for the internal FOR command
 - step-by-step execution of batch files (/Y)
 - fixed parsing of /C and /K arguments that was leading to spurious warnings
 - fixed %var% matching within batch files to be case-insensitive


=== ver 2022.1 (28.02.2022) ==================================================

 - added GOTO support (jumps to a labelled line within a batch file)
 - added CALL support (calls batch files from within batch files)
 - DOS errors are output to stdout, and also to stderr if stdout is redirected
 - fixed batch processing with /C (was executing only first command)
 - stack overflow detection degrades gracefully by invalidating command-line
   history (useful if a stack-hungry TSR overflows the RMOD stack)

 - added partial German translations (kindly provided by Robert Riebisch)
