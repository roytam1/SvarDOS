=== Batch files support ======================================================

When SvarCOM executes a command, it checks first if it has a *.BAT extension.
If so, it switches into 'batch-mode':
 - allocates a batch 'node', which is a memory area that contains the
   path and filename of the batch file, as well as the number of the "next
   line to be executed".
 - the batch node is attached to the batch chain (a pointer owned by rmod) if
   the batch file was CALLed from within another batch file, and replaced the
   current batch if it was simply executed from another batch file.

When the rmod batch pointer is non-NULL, SvarCOM does not ask the user for a
command. Instead, it opens the batch file, jumps to the "line line to be
executed" and loads the command from there, incrementing "next line" in the
process. The maximum length of a batch file is of 65535 lines (any lines after
this limit will be ignored).
