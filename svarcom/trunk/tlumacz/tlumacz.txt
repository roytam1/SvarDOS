tlumacz is a "compiler" that builds the SvarCOM multi-lang ressource file out
of a collection of CATS/Kitten text files.

 usage: tlumacz en fr pl ...

tlumacz generates a SVARCOM.LNG file that contains all language ressources.
This file must be then placed in the %NLSPATH% directory so SvarCOM can find it.
SvarCOM's language is controlled by the LANG variable (eg. "SET LANG=PL").

a DEFAULT.LNG file will also be generated, it contains translation strings
for english only. This file is only useful for building SvarCOM.
