tlumacz is a "compiler" that builds the SvarCOM multi-lang ressource file out
of a collection of CATS/Kitten text files.

 usage: tlumacz files

where "files" is the directory where all CATS/Kitten files are present.
tlumacz generates a SVARCOM.DAT file that contains all language ressources.
This file must be then placed in the %NLSPATH% directory so SvarCOM can find it.
SvarCOM's language is controlled by the LANG variable (eg. "SET LANG=PL").
