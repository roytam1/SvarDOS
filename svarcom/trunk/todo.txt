
                          === SVARCOM TODO LIST ===


This is a loose list of things that I'd like to implement within SvarCOM.


=== HIGH PRIORITY ============================================================

echo: no need to consider cmdline like a far ptr (it is not)
pipes redirections
DIR /A
ctrl+break handler
int 24h handler (abort, retry, fail, ignore)
advanced batch constructs: CALL, :labels, FOR, GOTO, IF EXIST/ERRORLEVEL


=== MEDIUM PRIORITY ==========================================================

provide unopened FCBs to launched applications
complete EN translation strings
translations should be cached in rmod-owned memory
if translations reloading fails, do not retry after every command
DIR /O
DIR /S (must use multiple DTAs recursively)
stdin redirection: command < file.txt
prompt $t, $d, $v


=== NICE TO HAVE =============================================================

respawn COMMAND.COM entirely from memory if it survived last application
DIR %DIRCMD% lookup
COPY /V
COPY /Y
COPY ASCII mode support?
"notify pending command" support (INT 2F,AX=AE00)
INT 2F,AX=5500 support
COMSPEC self-setting does not work under MS-DOS 5/6 (no exepath in env block)
compression of NLS strings and rmod core (lz4?)
dynamic resizing of environment space
CTTY
LOADHIGH/LH
tlumacz: detect incomplete translation files and fill missing strings with EN


====================================================================== EOF ===
