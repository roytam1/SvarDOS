                           |  SVARCOM TODO LIST  |
                           =======================


Below is a loose list of things that I'd like to implement within SvarCOM.

==============================================================================

BEFORE NEXT RELEASE:

pipes redirections
basic BAT support (without workflow controls, FOR loops etc)


AT SOME LATER TIME:

translations should be cached in rmod-owned memory
if translations reloading fails, do not retry after every command
stdin redirection: command < file.txt
DIR: /A
DIR: %DIRCMD% support
DIR: /O
DIR: /S (must use multiple DTAs recursively)
COPY: /V
command-line variables resolution (cd %MYDIR%)
storing rmod in a buffer that can be usefully reused once rmod is installed.
ctrl+break handler: http://www.techhelpmanual.com/563-int_23h__ctrl_break_exit_address.html

"notify pending command" int support: http://www.techhelpmanual.com/741-int_2fh_ae00h__notify_pending_command.html

INT 2F,AX=5500 support

stdout redirection should not create the output file if command fails
COMSPEC self-setting does not work under MS-DOS 5/6 (no exepath in env block)

when execing an external command make sure to sync local environment (or run the program with a custom environment pointer?)

when execing a program, make sure I use the correct PATH.. -> actually I need to parse PATH and look for matches myself for BAT support

dynamic resizing of environment space
single-stepping AUTOEXEC with F8 at boot time (/Y)
skipping AUTOEXEC with F5 at boot time (/D)
CTTY
LOADHIGH/LH

advanced batch files support:
 - CALL
 - :labels
 - FOR
 - GOTO
 - IF EXIST
 - IF ERRORLEVEL
 - SHIFT

==============================================================================
