
                          === SVARCOM TODO LIST ===


This is a loose list of things that I'd like to implement within SvarCOM.


=== HIGH PRIORITY ============================================================

pipes redirections
DIR /A
ctrl+break handler
int 24h handler (abort, retry, fail, ignore)
advanced batch support: CALL, :labels, FOR, GOTO, IF EXIST/ERRORLEVEL, SHIFT


=== MEDIUM PRIORITY ==========================================================

provide unopened FCBs to launched applications
completed EN translation strings
translations should be cached in rmod-owned memory
if translations reloading fails, do not retry after every command
DIR /O
DIR /S (must use multiple DTAs recursively)
stdin redirection: command < file.txt
prompt $t, $d, $v


=== NICE TO HAVE =============================================================

DIR: %DIRCMD% support
COPY /V
"notify pending command" support (INT 2F,AX=AE00)
INT 2F,AX=5500 support
stdout redirection should not create the output file if command fails
COMSPEC self-setting does not work under MS-DOS 5/6 (no exepath in env block)
compression of NLS strings and rmod core (lz4?)
dynamic resizing of environment space
CTTY
LOADHIGH/LH


==================================================================== [EOF] ===
