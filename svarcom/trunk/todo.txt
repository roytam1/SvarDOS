This is a loose list of things that I'd like to implement within SvarCOM.


=== BEFORE NEXT RELEASE ======================================================

pipes redirections
F5 skipping of autoexec.bat
handling of %VARS% in cmdline (BAT files or interactive queries)


=== AT SOME LATER TIME =======================================================

if translations reloading fails, do not retry after every command

DIR: /A
DIR: %DIRCMD% support
DIR: /O
DIR: /S (must use multiple DTAs recursively)

provide unopened FCBs to launched applications

stdout redirection should not create the output file if command fails
COMSPEC self-setting does not work under MS-DOS 5/6 (no exepath in env block)

compression of NLS strings and rmod core (lz4?)
