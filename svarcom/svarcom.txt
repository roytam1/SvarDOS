SvarCOM is the SvarDOS command line interpreter, known usually under the name
"COMMAND.COM". It is designed and maintained by Mateusz Viste, and distributed
under the terms of the MIT license.

For the time being, it is an incomplete, experimental project. The goal would
is to eventually make SvarCOM the default SvarDOS shell, replacing FreeCOM.


*** Why replacing FreeCOM, the FreeDOS COMMAND.COM? ***

FreeCOM is an impressive piece of software, but there are a few things that I
do not like about it. SvarCOM is my attempt at addressing these things.

- FreeCOM is not suitable for low-memory machines. It takes about 55K of
  conventional memory when XMS is unavailable. XMS being a 386+ thing, FreeCOM
  is a poor fit for pre-386 machines. There is the KSSF hack, but it is a
  kludg with many limitations.

  SvarDOS will not rely on XMS, and will perform swapping that works on any
  machine (similar to what MS-DOS did).

- FreeCOM requires custom NLS files. While the vast majority of FreeDOS
  programs use a single "standard" (CATS/Kitten), FreeCOM is using a different
  approach with pre-compiled NLS strings, which makes it necessary to
  distribute as many binary blobs as there are supported languages. It also
  makes the translation process much more difficult.

  SvarDOS will use Kitten-style translations, like other applications.

- FreeCOM is a complex beast: it aims for compatibility with multiple
  compilers and supports many features. This makes the code uneasy to follow
  and changes require careful testing on all supported compilers and all
  possible build variants.

  SvarDOS is meant to be simple and universal. It is meant to be compiled with
  OpenWatcom and nothing else. It also won't integrate features that can be
  implemented as third-party tools (typically: DOSKEY).
