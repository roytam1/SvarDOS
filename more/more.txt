
                                 SvarDOS MORE

SvarDOS MORE is a filter that displays output one screen at a time. It is part
of the SvarDOS project <http://svardos.org>, and as such it shares SvarDOS'
principles of minimalism, compactness and bare-bones functionality. It is:

 - multilingual (looks up the LANG env variable)
 - tiny (fits within a single disk sector)

Usage:

  MORE < FILE.TXT
  TYPE FILE.TXT | MORE

SvarDOS MORE is hand crafted in x86 assembly and built using the excellent
A72 assembler by Mr R. Swan <https://github.com/swanlizard/a72>.
