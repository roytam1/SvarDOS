 - fallback to %DOSDIR%\CFG\COUNTRY.SYS if target file not defined
 - when file doesn't exist, it should always be created (even if no
   modification switch has been used)
 - when trying to open a country.sys file that is not localcfg-computed, the
   error message should specifically say so
 - some more helpful messages when wrong options are inputed (instead of
   displaying the about screen over and over)
 - the usage instruction (COUNTRY=...) should mention the exact path to the
   file that we created, not an example
 - translation support (svarlang)
