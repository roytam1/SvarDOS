# Messages used by pdTree v1 and FreeDOS tree 3.6
# Each line is limited to 159 characters unless MAXLINE is changed,
# but if possible should be limited to 79 per line, with a \n
# added to indicate go to next line, max 2 lines.
# The messages are split into sets,
# where each set corresponds to a given function in pdTree.
# Set 1, is for main and common strings.
# Many of the strings are used directly by printf,
# so when a %? appears, be sure any changes also include the %?
# where ? is a variable identifier and format.
# Note: only \\, \n, \r, \t are supported (and a single slash must use \\).
