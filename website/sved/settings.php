The SvarDOS editor (SVED) is designed for basic editing of configuration files
and such. It is NOT meant to be a full-featured text editor. On the pro side,
it has a low memory footprint and is only a couple kilobytes big, which makes
it a good fit for bootdisks or systems with extremely limited ressources.
