<p>SvarCOM is the SvarDOS command line interpreter, known usually under the name \"COMMAND.COM\". It is designed and maintained by Mateusz Viste, and distributed under the terms of the MIT license.</p>

<p>For the time being, it is a work-in-progress project that - although functional - is not entirely polished yet and might miss a few bits and pieces. SvarCOM version 2022.x must be considered a \"preview\" version. See the documentation included in the zip file for details.</p>

<p>SvarCOM is minimalist and I'd like to keep it that way. It aims to be functionally equivalent to COMMAND.COM from MS-DOS 5.x/6.x. No LFN support.</p>

<p>SvarCOM's resident footprint is under 2 KiB.</p>
