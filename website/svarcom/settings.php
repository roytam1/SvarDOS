<p>SvarCOM is the SvarDOS command line interpreter, known usually under the name \"COMMAND.COM\". It is designed and maintained by Mateusz Viste, and distributed under the terms of the MIT license.</p>

<p>SvarCOM is minimalist and I'd like to keep it that way. It aims to be functionally equivalent to COMMAND.COM from MS-DOS 5.x/6.x. No LFN support.</p>

<p>SvarCOM's resident footprint is about 2 KiB.</p>
