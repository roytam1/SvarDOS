    <h1>SvarDOS - an open-source DOS distribution</h1>
    <p class="copyr">for PCs of the 1980-2000 era</p>

    <p>SvarDOS is an open-source project that is meant to integrate the best out of the currently available DOS tools, drivers and games. DOS development has been abandoned by commercial players a long time ago, mostly during early nineties. Nowadays it survives solely through the efforts of hobbyists and retro-enthusiasts, but this is a highly sparse and unorganized ecosystem. SvarDOS aims to collect available DOS software and make it easy to find and install applications using a network-enabled package manager (like apt-get, but for DOS and able to run on a 8086 PC).</p>

    <h2>Minimalist and 8086-compatible</h2>

    <p>Once installed, SvarDOS is a minimalistic DOS system that offers only a DOS kernel, a command interpreter and the most basic tools for system administration. It is then up to the user to install additional packages. Care is taken so SvarDOS remains 8086-compatible, at least in its most basic (core) configuration.</p>

    <h2>Open-source</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is published under the terms of the MIT license. This applies only to SvarDOS-specific files, though - the auxilliary packages supplied with SvarDOS may be subject to different licenses (GPL, BSD, Public Domain, Freeware...).</p>

    <h2>Multilingual</h2>

    <p>The system can be set up in a wide selection of languages: English, German, French, Polish, Russian, Italian and more.</p>

    <h2>No "versions"</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is a rolling release, meaning that it does not adhere to the concept of "versions". Once the system is installed, its packages can be kept up-to-date using the SvarDOS online update tools (pkg &amp; pkgnet).</p>

    <h2>Community and help</h2>

    <p>Need to get in touch? Wish to submit some packages, translate SvarDOS to your language, or otherwise contribute? Or maybe you'd like some information about SvarDOS?

    <?php // the "default" build proposed on the main page is read from default_build.txt
    $lastver = trim(file_get_contents('default_build.txt'));

    echo '<h2>Downloads (build ' . $lastver . ')</h2>'
    ?>

    <p>SvarDOS is available in a variety of installation images. Some may be available as multilingual and English-only. The EN-only variants are smaller because they miss all the translations, which makes them fit on a lower number of floppy disks. You can always upgrade an EN-only installation to multilingual support simply by upgrading its packages.</p>
