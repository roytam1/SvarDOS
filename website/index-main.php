    <p>SvarDOS is an open-source project that is meant to integrate the best out of the currently available DOS tools, drivers and games. DOS development has been abandoned by commercial players a very long time ago, mostly during early nineties. Nowadays, it survives solely through the efforts of hobbyists and retro-enthusiasts, but this is a highly sparse and unorganized ecosystem. SvarDOS aims to collect available DOS software, package it and make it easy to find and install applications using a network-enabled package manager.</p>

    <h2>SvarDOS is minimalist and 8086-compatibe</h2>

    <p>Once installed, SvarDOS is a minimalistic DOS system that offers only the most basic tools for system administration. It is up to the user to install additional packages. Care is taken so SvarDOS remains 8086-compatible, at least in its most basic (core) configuration.</p>

    <h2>SvarDOS is open-source</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS files are published under the terms of the MIT license. This applies only to SvarDOS-specific files, though - the packages may be subject to different licenses (GPL, BSD, Public Domain, Freeware...).</p>

    <h2>SvarDOS has no "versions"</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is a "rolling" release, meaning that it doesn't follow the concept of "versions". Once installed, SvarDOS can be kept up-to-date trough its online update tool.</p>

    <h2>The community</h2>
