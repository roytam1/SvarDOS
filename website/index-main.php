    <div style="margin: 2em auto; width: 21em; border: 1px #777 solid; background-color: #fff; padding: 0.1em 0.5em; color: #a00; font-size: 1.1em;">This project is very much "work-in-progress", not everything works yet!</div>

    <p>SvarDOS is an open-source project that is meant to integrate the best out of the currently available DOS tools, drivers and games. DOS development has been abandoned by commercial players a very long time ago, mostly during early nineties. Nowadays, it survives solely through the efforts of hobbyists and retro-enthusiasts, but this is a highly sparse and unorganized ecosystem. SvarDOS aims to collect available DOS software, package it and make it easy to find and install applications using a network-enabled package manager (like apt-get, but for DOS and able to run even on a 8086 PC).</p>

    <h2>Minimalist and 8086-compatibe</h2>

    <p>Once installed, SvarDOS is a minimalistic DOS system that offers only the most basic tools for system administration. It is up to the user to install additional packages. Care is taken so SvarDOS remains 8086-compatible, at least in its most basic (core) configuration.</p>

    <h2>Open-source</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS files are published under the terms of the MIT license. This applies only to SvarDOS-specific files, though - the packages supplied with SvarDOS may be subject to different licenses (GPL, BSD, Public Domain, Freeware...).</p>

    <h2>No "versions"</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is a "rolling" release, meaning that it doesn't follow the concept of "versions". Once the system is installed, its packages can be kept up-to-date using the SvarDOS online update tools (pkgnet &amp; pkginst).</p>

    <h2>Community and help</h2>
