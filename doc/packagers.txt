=== HOW TO CREATE A PACKAGE? ==================================================

Packaging software for SvarDOS implies creating an SVP package that can be
installed with "pkg". This file will not discuss this aspect, you should find
all necessary information about this topic in the SvarDOS help:

 * help pkgfmt
 * help pkgrules


=== WHO CAN UPLOAD PACKAGES TO TO THE SVARDOS REPO? ===========================

Only the team of SvarDOS packagers is allowed to upload new or updated packages
to the SvarDOS online repository. If you are not one of them, please get in
touch with us through the SvarDOS mailing list. If you are a packager, then
keep reading.


=== INITIAL SVN SETUP (REPOSITORY CHECKOUT) ===================================

Note that all instructions are implying the usage of the command-line
subversion client, as available on all Linux distributions.

SvarDOS packages are stored in the project's svn tree, hence the first thing to
do is for you to pull the SvarDOS subversion tree. You must have obtained
credentials to svn access already. To fetch the SvarDOS package repository
to your local disk, use such svn checkout:

$ svn co svn://YOURLOGIN@svn.svardos.org/svardos-pkgs

It is a one time only action that should create a "svardos-pkgs" directory
on your disk. Inside you will find all SvarDOS packages.


=== UPLOADING A NEW PACKAGE ===================================================

So you have created this new SvarDOS SVP package with some very cool software
in it. Great! To upload it to the SvarDOS online repo, copy your new package
to your local svardos-packages directory. Then, instruct svn to add the new
file(s) to the repo:

$ cd svardos-pkgs
$ svn add package-ver.svp
$ svn add package-ver.zip   <-- optional, only if package has available sources

Review the changes to make sure you added the right files:
$ svn st

...and if everything's all right, push (commit) the changes to the svn server:

$ svn commit -m 'new package added: PACKAGE_NAME'

Done! Your package should appear in the online repository within a minute or
two.


=== UPDATING A PACKAGE (ADD A NEW VERSION) ====================================

Let's imagine that we have a package named NASM in version 2.12. A new version
2.15 of this software has been released, you tested it, found it stable so you
packaged it. How to add it to the SvarDOS packages repository?

Add the new version of your package:

$ svn add nasm-2.15.svp
$ svn add nasm-2.15.zip              <-- optional (only if package has sources)

Finally, review and commit your changes:

$ svn st
$ svn commit -m 'updated package NASM to version 2.15'

The repository server will automatically serve the latest available version as
the "preferred" version to users. The version strings are processed (and
compared with each other) through the PHP version_compare() function documented
here: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.version-compare>

This function works relatively well, but it might fail on some exotic version
strings. For the time being, there is no way to flag a specific package version
as being "preferred".


=== REMOVING A PACKAGE ========================================================

On rare occasions it may be necessary to delete some packages. For example if
they proved to be harmful in some way, or if their licensing is not compatible
with SvarDOS distribution, etc. Removing a package means deleting it from the
svn repository and commiting the change. Example:

$ cd svardos-pkgs
$ svn del package.svp
$ svn del package.zip       <-- only if zip with sources exists
$ svn commit -m 'removed package PACKAGE_NAME because (reason here)'
